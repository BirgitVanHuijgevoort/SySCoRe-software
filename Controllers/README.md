# SySCoRe - Controllers

## Control synthesis
- *Synthesize Controller*: Compute satisfaction probability and controller based on value iterations
- *Synthesize Robust Controller*: Compute satisfaction probability and 
   controller while taking into account epsilon and delta errors. 

## Evaluate controller
- *E_Reach_time*: Compute expected reach time for satisfying the 
    temporal logic specification for a given controller and system


## Control refinment
-------- To be Done ----
Control refinement as a class ?
- control refinment pure function of coupling + relation
- control refinement function of value function + relation
- control refinement as separate function together with def of simulation
