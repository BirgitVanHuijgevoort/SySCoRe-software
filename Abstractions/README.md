# SySCoRe - Abstractions

## Gridding 
- *GridSpace_2d*:  Basic gridding functionality which only works for 2D systems
- *GridSpace_nd*: Basic gridding functionality that could work also for nD systems
- *GridSpace_nonlin_tensor*: Separate gridding of noise (per dimension) and deterministic contributions
- *GridSpace_nonlin_tensor_v2*: Separate gridding of noise (per dimension) and deterministic contributions, 
                            works also for non identity Bw

# Labelling
TODO:
- Make sure that nondeterministic labelling is performed over the OUTPUT of the abstract model

## Model order reduction
TODO:
 - Model order reduction (Hankel order reduction, ... )


# Removing stochastics
TODO:  
- Stochastic to deterministic
