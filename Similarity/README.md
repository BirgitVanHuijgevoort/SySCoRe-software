# SySCoRe -- Similarity relations

- Different simulation relations
  - eps delta / delta non det labelling
  - Sub probability
  - ....
  - partially observable systems



- ComputeDelta is based on the following publication
van Huijgevoort, B. C., and Sofie Haesaert.
"Similarity quantification for linear stochastic systems as a set-theoretic control problem."
arXiv preprint arXiv:2007.09052 (2020).


TODO:
- ComputeDelta: make sure it works for different input dimensions (for u)
- ComputeDelta: make sure that it works for different state dimensions (for x)

- include optimization that calculates bounds for epsilon/delta (so that give delta=1 and delta=0)
