# SySCoRe
SySCoRe stands for Synthesis via Stochastic Coupling Relations for stochastic continuous state systems. It is a toolbox that synthesizes controllers for stochastic continuous-state systems to satisfy temporal logic specifications. Starting from a system description and a co-safe temporal logic specification, SySCoRe provides all necessary functions for synthesizing a robust controller and quantifying the associated formal robustness guarantees. It distinguishes itself from other available tools by supporting nonlinear dynamics, complex co-safe temporal logic specifications over infinite horizons and model-order reduction.

To achieve this, SySCoRe first generates a finite-state abstraction of the provided model and performs probabilistic model checking. Then, it establishes a probabilistic coupling to the original stochastic system encoded in an approximate simulation relation, based on which a lower bound on the satisfaction probability is computed. SySCoRe provides non-trivial lower bounds for infinite-horizon properties and unbounded disturbances since its computed error does not grow linear in the horizon of the specification. It exploits a tensor representation to facilitate the efficient computation of transition probabilities. We showcase these features on several tutorials.

## 4. Common issues
The most common error is the following:

Error when converting LTL to Buchi
Output argument "B" (and possibly others) not assigned a value in the execution with "create_buchi" function.

There are multiple reasons this error occurs:
- you are not in the root folder when running a script. Make sure that your current location is the SySCoRe folder (instead of for example the Turorials folder).
- not all folders are added to the path. Verify if the folder SySCoRe and all subfolders are in your path. You can add them to your path by right-clicking on the SySCoRe folder and click "Add to path" > "Selected Folders and Subfolders". If you want to save this path, type savepath in the Command Window. 
- you do not have access to the executable. To verify this, go to your SySCoRe installation and navigate to the folder SySCoRe/Specification/LTL2BA/ltl2ba. There should be an executable file called ltl2ba. Verify that you have read and write access to this file.
